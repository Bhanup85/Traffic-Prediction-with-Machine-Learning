# Traffic-Prediction-with-Machine-Learning
Traffic prediction utilizes data analysis and machine learning to forecast traffic patterns. By analyzing historical data, weather conditions, and other factors, predictive models estimate future traffic conditions. This improves traffic management, infrastructure planning, and provides real-time information to optimize transportation efficiency.
